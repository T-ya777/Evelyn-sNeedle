# Description:
Evelyn's Needle is an interactive drawing application built using the cmu_graphics framework. It provides a simple, fun interface for users to design clothing, accessories, and patterns that constantly wiggle onto a virtual figure projected to people in real-time camera.

### How to play:
Click start to draw your crafts on the white canvas. While drawing, you can use fill to fill in the closed area with either dots, lines, stars or plain color. You can also draw lines, adjust pen color and width. First you will draw hats, and some decorations on face. Hit next to draw clothes. After finishing, you will activate the real time camera and your crafts will project on your face and body. Go back to homescreen to check craft history and photo history.
